Chapter Objectives:

   - Define callback functions
   - Define higher order functions
   - Use a callback function to make your code more general
   - Create callback functions using anonyomus functions


***  CALLBACK FUNCTIONS ***


    - Callback function is a function that is passed into another function as a parameter then invoked by that other function
    - AKA calling a function in a function as a parameter

 
    Callback Example:

        **see callback-example.js

Higher Order Function:

    - A function that accepts a callback as a parameter


What are callbacks used for?

    - Advanced Array Methods
    - Browser Events
    - AJAX Requests
    - React


***  STACK & HEAP ***

    What is the stack?
        - An ordered data structure
        - Keeps track of function invocations
        - Part of the JavaScript runtime
        - Always processed from top to bottom

    - When the function is done running and returns a value, the function is POPPED from the stack and can move on

    Stack Frame:

        - Includes
            - Function that was invoked
            - The parameters passed
            - The line of the function

    What is the Heap?

        - An area in memory where your data is stored


***  setTimeout and setInterval ***


  setTimeout    
    - function that asynchronously invokes a callback after a delay in milliseconds


***  Event Loop and the Queue ***

    The Queue 
        - Ordered list of functions waiting to be placed on the stack
        - Functions in the queue are processed on a first in, first out basis

    The Event Loop
        - Functionality in the JS runtime that checks the queue when the stack is empty
        - If the stack is empty the front of the queue is placed in the stack

    Ex: 

        - setTimeout function with a wait time of 0ms, gets placed on the queue, and will execute when the stack is empty 
            therefor, it will run after other functions on the page that don't have a callback

    JavaScript is Single Threaded
        - Code execution is linear
        - Code that is running cannot be interrupted by something else going on in the program
